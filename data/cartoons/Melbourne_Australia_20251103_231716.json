      "title": "Yarra River Test",
      "premise": "An Australian cricketer, mid-swing, accidentally hits the ball so hard it lands in the Yarra, turning the notoriously brown river momentarily green.",
      "why_funny": "Playing on the Yarra's reputation and the absurd visual of instant river discolouration."

      "title": "The G's Psychic Pigeon",
      "premise": "A pigeon at the MCG is consistently predicting wickets before they happen, infuriating the bookies and baffling Shane Warne's ghost.",

      "title": "The Tim Tam Slam Dunk",
      "premise": "After a six, a fan tries to do a Tim Tam Slam with their beer, only to find the melted chocolate ruins their brand-new team jersey.",

      "premise": "The Australian team rubs Vegemite on the ball for extra grip, resulting in an unusually sticky wicket and bewildered Indian batsmen.",
      "why_funny": "Classic Aussie icon used in a ridiculous way, causing unexpected consequences and baffling opponents."
